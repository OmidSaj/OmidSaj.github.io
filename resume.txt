Experience

CORE Studio at Thornton Tomasetti 
  NYC, NY  
Associate AI/ML Engineer (2024 - Present)

-	Developed a vectorized reinforcement learning environment for physics-based environment evaluation accelerating agent training by 2000x on CPU and 4000x on GPU on local servers. 
-	Conducted UX surveys and in-person interviews with 50+ engineers, driving increased adoption of data science solutions and tailoring them to business-aligned engineering needs. 
-	Built and deployed 3 engineering Copilot applications used by +300 engineers internally. 
-	Developed a custom ReAct LLM agent with advanced reasoning capabilities, accessing 25+ complex engineering tools, optimizing for latency, token usage, and operational costs in production.
-	Developed a contract review system by orchestrating a multi-modal agentic workflow.

Senior AI/ML Engineer (2023)

-	Created the firm’s first Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot, leveraging TF-IDF, BM25, and vector embeddings for enhanced hybrid search and retrieval.
-	Developed “MarkGPT,” a marketing chatbot that provided insights from 5000 project sheets and 10,000 resumes, streamlining marketing efforts and enhancing project proposals.
-	Built an LLM agent to preserve domain-specific knowledge from a retired engineer, answering 12,000 construction questions using years of correspondence data, work featured in unfrozen podcast. (link to podcast: https://unfrozenarch.net/episodes/domo-arigatou-mike-20)
-	Led the development of the firm’s first ML model for large stadium roof design, achieving 95% testing accuracy on synthetic data and 97% alignment with a constructed stadium in Florida.
-	AI strategy consultation and services to a Japanese firm, providing packages for data cleaning, ML, and domain specific evaluations.

AI/ML Engineer (2022)

-	Developed the first generative ML model for structural design at the firm using, improving design flexibility. This framework was later adopted in 4 projects by 2 other team members.
-	Developed an ML pipeline for the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), developing a database from infrastructure reports, augmenting features, and delivering visual insights and a forecast model to predict condition assessments. This effort led to securing future collaboration with FDOT. 
-	ML engineer in collaboration with Heatherwick Studios, London, to integrate a custom stable diffusion model in Rhino 3D.  

Summer Internship (2021)

-	Developed a cloud-optimized algorithm for structural steel design, generating 50x more data 24x faster.
